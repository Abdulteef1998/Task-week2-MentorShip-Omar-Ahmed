# Task Week2 â€” MentorShip Project

**Anime / Movies Display App** built with Flutter and Clean Architecture principles.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Structure & Architecture

This project applies the *Clean Architecture* pattern, dividing code into distinct layers for better separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability:

ib/
â”£ core/ # Shared utilities, constants, theme, images, etc.
â”ƒ â”£ utils/
â”ƒ â”£ app_constants.dart
â”ƒ â”£ app_images.dart
â”ƒ â”— app_theme.dart
â”ƒ
â”£ features/
â”ƒ â”£ home/
â”ƒ â”£ detail/
â”ƒ â”£ plan/
â”ƒ â”£ rating/
â”ƒ â”£ search/
â”ƒ â”— setting/


- **core/**: Contains app-wide constants, theme definitions, image assets references, and utility functions.
- **features/**: Each feature (home, detail, plan, rating, search, setting) is modularized â€” this helps you isolate logic, UI, and data for each feature.
- **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.
